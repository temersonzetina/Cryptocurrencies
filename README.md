# Cryptocurrencies

Overview
In this analysis, I transformed a set of cryptocurrency data to observe how each coin compares with one another based on key criteria, such as the total coins mined (TotalCoinsMIned) and in existence (TotalCoinSupply). I created a model involving principal components to reduce several of the key variables to just 3 principal components. Admittedly, doing so only accounted for about 6% of the variance; only a fraction of the total information can be attributed to the 3 components, making the model somewhat weak.
